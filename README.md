# Minesweeper

Minesweeper, inspired by the classic Minesweeper game. Except it has a UWaterloo twist (as the University of Waterloo is known for having tons of Canadian Geese). 

It asks the user to enter the number of rows, columns, and geese on the board. The user then has to try to win the game by clearing all tiles without a goose.
